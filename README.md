# Predicting Overall Satisfaction
A classification problem, focused on predicting overall customer satisfaction.

My team won our hackathon based on category prediction. It required a combination of technical skills, creativity, and teamwork, and Iâ€™m proud of what we accomplished.

I had the opportunity to contribute code, ideas, and research skills towards the successful completion of the project. 
The keys to success in a hackathon are collaboration and the ability to think outside the box. 
By working closely, we leveraged our unique skills to develop a solution that not only met the requirements of the hackathon, but also exceeded expectations.

Note: the data referenced in the notebook is for bullet train passengers. Later, I created a Kaggle competition, with similar sets from airline passengers.
